# Path-Finding-Visualizer

Overview

This project is a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms, providing a graphical interface to observe how various AI algorithms find paths from a starting point to a destination. The visualizer helps in understanding and comparing the efficiency and behavior of different algorithms such as A*, Hill Climbing, Breadth-First Search (BFS).
